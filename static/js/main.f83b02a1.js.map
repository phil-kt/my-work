He must take these medications daily in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and Thomas is very worried about his father properly taking these medications. In order to ensure his father takes his pills properly, Thomas is interested in a pill dispenser with a companion app that allows him to track his father\\u2019s pill intake and alerts him if his father misses a dose so he can follow up with his father or the doctor to keep Harrison healthy. Due to his work Thomas is often not home and although his family is there to help take care of Harry, he would like to have extra peace of mind so that it\\u2019s ensured that his father never forgets to take his prescriptions.

During this playtime, and after the craze died down, I was interested in designing and developing an augmented reality experience of my own for people to try out.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Upon arriving to Georgia Tech, I discovered that there was a lab dedicated to augmented reality in the <a href=\"http://ael.gatech.edu/lab/\" target=\"_blank\">Augmented Environments lab</a>. One of my fellow classmates was going to work on a project for the lab and she invited me to come to her next meeting with the professor. I accompanied her, met <a href=\"http://www.jdbolter.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Bolter</a>, and began work on Understanding AR.\n            </p>\n            <h4>What I Did</h4>\n            <p>\n              Determined the list of projects to represent, designed the concept of the book and how it would work, created 3D models in Blender, and developed code in Twine and Javascript for storybook features.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Process</h4>\n            <img className=\"process\" src={process} alt=\"Concept, history milestones, user flows, 3d modeling, javascript prototype, twine integration\"/>\n\n            <h4>Concept</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Understanding AR is a project inspired by Scott McCloud's book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics\" target=\"blank\">Understanding Comics</a>, which is a meta work that describes how to write and draw comics through the use of comics. Professor Bolter really liked this work, and wondered if we could do the same with augmented reality: create an augmented reality application about augmented reality. My partner, Victoria, and I took up this challenge and sought to create an AR book about the history and development of AR. We identified what we considered key moments in augmented history worth representing:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)\" target=\"_blank\">Sword of Damocles by Ivan Sutherland (1968)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoplace\" target=\"_blank\">Videoplace by Myron Kreuger (1975)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTap\" target=\"_blank\">EyeTap by Steve Mann (1980)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_fixture\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Fixtures by Louis Rosenburg for Air Force (1992)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://artoolkit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARToolkit by Hirokazu Kato (1999)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://wearables.unisa.edu.au/projects/arquake/\" target=\"_blank\">ARQuake by Bruce Thomas (2000)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\" target=\"_blank\">Google Glass beta test (2013)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Hololens (2015)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://www.pokemongo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PokemonGO (2016)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://argonjs.io\" target=\"_blank\">ArgonJS Framework (2015 - now)</a></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n              With these 10 milestones in mind, we set out to develop a book that could tell this history of how augmented reality came to be in today's day and age.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Design</h4>\n            <p>\n              We had a couple different ways we could approach the book. We could keep it a traditional narrative where the reader has to flip through each history object one by one. However, because the reader can look at any image they want, and augmented reality to me inspires movement and spontaneity, we decided that <b>you can look at any piece you want to learn about it, much like a museum exhibition.</b> This keeps the app simple and easy to hop from piece to piece.\n            </p>\n            <img src={flow} alt=\"flow sketch\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">User flow sketched by my <a href=\"http://victoriachai.me\" target=\"_blank\">teammate</a></p>\n            <h4>Implementation</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              In order to create our storybook, we used the augmented reality framework developed by the lab called <a href=\"http://argonjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Argon.js</a>. It's a javascript framework developed by <a href=\"https://blairmacintyre.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Blair MacIntyre</a>, the head of the Augmented Environments lab. We used Argon along with <a href=\"https://twinery.org/\">Twine</a> and <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\">a-frames</a> to create our AR experience.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n  The general workflow was that I would create 3D models of the historical event we wanted to signify, and save them as .obj format so that they could be plugged into an a-frame and be rendered on the web. Once we had the model, we would write up a description of the event in Twine, and link it all up to a main storyline. We also had to save the images we wanted in <a href=\"https://www.vuforia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vuforia</a>, so that looking at an image would trigger the correct model to render.\n            </p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={eyetap} alt=\"eyetap model\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">3D model of EyeTap in Blender</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={vuforia} alt=\"vuforia ratings\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Sketches by my teammate to increase vuforia recognition</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={twine} alt=\"screenshot of twine\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A look at the Twine storyboard</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n            <h4>The Exhibits</h4>\n            <img src={argon_all} alt=\"all the storyboards\" className=\"no-height-limit\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">A look at all the models and articles for them</p>\n            <h4>In Action</h4>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={google_glass} alt=\"eyetap live\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Google Glass model</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={quake_live} alt=\"quake live\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Quake model</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={pokemon} alt=\"pokemon go\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">What you actually see from the iPhone itself</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n            <h4>Conclusion</h4>\n            <p>Overall from this project I came to understand that AR on the web is still very much in its infancy, but that there are not very high barriers to entry from both the developer and the consumer side, which is promising for the future of mobile web augmented reality.

All drawings are anonymous, and can only be viewed by those in the same location as you looking at the same wall, ceiling, floor, what have you. In order for graffiti to work we used the gyroscope and GPS to gather location and orientation data to maintain the context the graffiti is drawn on so that you don't see random drawings floating in the air (unless intended to be placed there!)\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Design Sketches</h4>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={front} alt=\"front end logic of graffiti\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"sketches-description\">Sketches of the initial screens of graffiti, and the front end logic of a drawing layer, a camera layer, and the main activity layer.

The Hive was conceived through research done for Georgia Tech's MS-HCI program, and aims to make it simpler and faster to find study spots for students at Georgia Tech's library, the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center (CULC).\n            </p>\n\n            <img src={leadin} alt=\"preview of the hive\" />\n\n            <h4>Problem Space</h4>\n            <p>\n              The concept for The Hive came about after noticing that students at the library often struggle to find seats, due to there being no easy way to see if certain seats were taken or not, which led to students walking around different floors for several minutes trying to find a suitable studying space. Having personally experienced this ourselves as well, we thought it would be useful to try and solve the problem of finding a seat so students could focus on studying, not searching for a place to work.\n            </p>\n            <img src={crowded} alt=\"no seaing library\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">The struggle is real come finals time</p>\n\n            <h4>What I Did</h4>\n            <p>\n            My contributions to this project include:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Defining the data we were interested in collecting for our problem space</li>\n                <li>Conducting interview sessions with users</li>\n                <li>Creating interview questions</li>\n                <li>Creating a task analysis after reviewing interview data</li>\n                <li>Development of a persona for a potential user</li>\n                <li>Brainstorming of design solutions</li>\n                <li>Modeling and coding of a Unity prototype for The Hive</li>\n                <li>Conducting user tests with both virtual and physical prototypes in the library</li>\n              </ul>\n\n            <h4>Process</h4>\n            <img className=\"process\" src={process} alt=\"Survey & interviews, Pattern analysis, Refine problem, Ideation, Prototype, User Testing, Feedback, Findings\" />\n\n            <h4>Research</h4>\n            <p>\n              After finding our problem space, we then began to conduct research on how exactly students use the CULC, how many have struggled finding a seat before, and other data points so that we could see if this was a real issue that needed solving. We began by distributing a survey, conducting semi-structured interviews with random individuals in the library, and observing how students use the space as well as how long it can take them to find seats.  <b>We primarily based our results on the semi-structured interviews, as they allowed us to really understand the behavior of the students and what leads them to come to library and how they approach studying there.</b>\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"statistics\">\n              <div className=\"statistic\">\n                <h2 className=\"surveys\">28</h2>\n                <p>survey responses</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"statistic\">\n                <h2 className=\"interviews\">23</h2>\n                <p>students interviewed</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"statistic\">\n                <h2 className=\"observations\">2</h2>\n                <p>hours of observations</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <p>Our research results revealed that students often use the library for group work due to its noisier nature compared to the library, and its central location. When questioning students about seats, some of them outright stated that they never had problems finding seats, but rather finding tables. Our observations enforced this point, as we noticed an abundance of free chairs in the library. So many free chairs in fact, students were using them as footrests or to create makeshift beds. However table space was scarce, and once students left a table it was quickly occupied by a new group. Some students opted to sit on the floor, even when there were open seats left, due to the space afforded by spreading stuff out on the ground.</p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings} className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={affinity_map} alt=\"affinity map\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}} />\n                <p className=\"caption\">\n                  Affinity mapping out our research data\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={task_analysis} alt=\"task analysis\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}} />\n                <p className=\"caption\">\n                  A task analysis I derived from our research\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <h4>Refinements</h4>\n            <p>\n              After completing our research and analyzing the findings, we realized that we were asking the wrong question in our problem space. <b>It turns out that there is not much difficulty in finding an open seat in the CULC; the problem lies in finding an available table.</b>\n            </p>\n\n            <p>This led us to shift our attention on finding available seating to finding available tables. During observations, it was made clear that there are plenty of unoccupied chairs. However, table space was precious and most tables were quick to be taken as soon as students left them. After talking to students, we were also interested in making refinements into how our solution could convey different information depending on context, such as if group seating is available or noise levels of the seats.</p>\n\n\n\n            <h4>Design Ideas</h4>\n            <p>\n              Based on this new problem area and the data we collected, we then began to ideate on possible solutions for finding tables in the library. We went through an exhaustive list of design possibilities, which ranged concepts such as a flag to indicate if you were open to others sitting at your table to stringing ropes across the CULC to create a sort of large scale hammock for people to sit and work on, we eventually narrowed down to three final designs:\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Solution 1</h4>\n            <p className=\"sub-header-p\">Display a screen at every floor showing seat distribution so students know where to find a seat, while also projecting seat information onto the wooden railings on each staircase.</p>\n\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={screen} alt=\"screen solution\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Possible visualizations of the heatmap and seat occupancy levels</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={screen_storyboard} alt=\"screen storyboard\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A storyboard for the screen solution</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <h4>Solution 2</h4>\n            <p className=\"sub-header-p\">\n              Introduce modular furniture that can be a seat or a table depending on the need, therefore increasing the amount of tables in circulation and making seating exist wherever it is needed.\n            </p>\n\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={furniture} alt=\"modular furniture\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Some concepts of what the furniture could look like</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={furniture_storyboard} alt=\"modular furniture storyboard\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A storyboard for modular furniture</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n\n            <h4>Solution 3</h4>\n            <p>A tree installation that can show students where seats are available from a glance, by following the path of branches lit by fiber optics, which change brightness depending on crowdedness and pulse based on noise levels.</p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={tree} alt=\"tree solution\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A concept drawing of the tree</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={tree_storyboard} alt=\"tree storyboard\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A storyboard for the tree's role in finding a seat</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n\n            <p>\n              We arrived at these designs by following two different approaches for our solution:\n            </p>\n           <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Make seating and tables easier to find</li>\n              <li>Increase the amount of tables available</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <p>\n            Both solution 1 and 3 are based on the first approach, as they aim to make it easier and faster for students to find an available table at the library and begin their work. However, not wanting to overlook an obvious solution of simply adding more tables, we also designed a solution that would provide students with more workspaces, which solution 2 comes from.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>The Tree</h4>\n            <p>\n            After feedback from our peers and discussion amongst ourselves, we decided to go with solution 3, the tree. The reason being that although solution 1 was conventional and certainly would have worked, the tree grants the benefit of knowing which floor to go to immediately instead of having to climb past every floor to see that statistics for the floor. The other reason being we wanted a solution with a spirit of art in it. Solution 2 was abandoned as it featured no computer in its design, and this being a human-computer interaction course our professor told us no, haha.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n            The advantages of the tree, or The Hive as I will refer to it from now on, are several:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Students can see which floors are less crowded from any point in the CULC </li>\n              <li>The branches of the tree directs students to which areas are less populated</li>\n              <li>Can disseminate more information in a single structure (Such as noise levels and crowdedness)</li>\n              <li>It looks prettier</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <h4>Prototype</h4>\n            <p>\n            In order to prototype and test The Hive, it we required a bit of creativity on our part. Sadly we did not have the funds or feasibility to construct a full scale model of a tree in the CULC, so we made a small physical model out of cardboard, an Arduino, and EL wire to produce the desired effect of The Hive.\n            </p>\n\n            <img src={tree_live} alt=\"real life model of the tree\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">Our IRL tree</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Knowing that wouldn't provide enough immersion to have a user test it, I also developed a simulation of the tree using Blender and Unity so a user could play a first person walkthrough of encountering our tree in the CULC and using it to find a seat.\n            </p>\n\n            <a href=\"http://philkt.me/The-Hive\" target=\"_blank\">\n              <img src={tree_unity} alt=\"unity demo of tree\" />\n            </a>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              The Unity demo I made, click the image to try it!\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Using these two prototypes, we set up in the library and asked random individuals who were passing by to test our solution if they had the time. They were assigned a task of finding a seat using the Unity prototype, and then asked several questions regarding the physical prototype, such as where they would go based on the current orientation of the tree, differentiation of the colors, and then were given a post-testing interview consisting of several questions to gather feedback design recommendations.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Feedback</h4>\n            <p>\n              After conducting several user tests, this was the feedback we received on our prototype:\n            </p>\n              <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>The colors were somewhat of an issue; the meaning of blue/green wasn't intuitive, and some people had difficulty differentiating between them</li>\n                <li>The look might not fit in with the CULC's aesthetic since it is not industrial</li>\n                <li>It's eye-catching but not distracting </li>\n                <li>Some people liked it more than a simple display, others did not</li>\n              </ol>\n            <p>\n              Overall, it seems as though people liked the concept of the tree, however the colors needed to be tweaked for the final product, as well as the overall aesthetic of the tree changed to match the CULC's in order for it to match. Thankfully these complaints are mostly about things that were decided on due to our constraint on time to produce this interim prototype, and were further explored in our next round of testing.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Testing Round 2</h4>\n            <p>\n              After making revisions on our prototype, we then tested our prototype again, once more asking random passerbys in the library if they'd like to participate in a brief experiment. The process for this testing was a lot more structured than the first time:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Users explore an empty Unity scene of the virtual library to get accustomed to controls</li>\n              <li>Users are assigned the task of finding a seat in the library without our tree</li>\n              <li>Users again try to find a seat, but this time with our tree in the simulation</li>\n              <li>Users are asked questions about their experience and of the simulation and about the physical model</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <img src={tree_v2} alt=\"newer version of tree\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">A look at the updated model</p>\n\n            <h4>Final Results</h4>\n            <div className=\"statistics\">\n              <div className=\"statistic\">\n                <h2 className=\"surveys\">5</h2>\n                <p>students tested</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"statistic\">\n                <h3 className=\"interviews\">50%</h3>\n                <p>reduction in search time</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n              We tested five students, and each student had a <b>reduction of at least 50% time in finding a seat</b> between the standard library model and the tree model. Seats weren't placed in the same location, but were on the same floors to try and keep times somewhat standard across tests. Students were also able to quickly discern the meaning behind the tree's colors and branches during their think-aloud.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>We also received several design suggestions from our testers that could be implemented in a future model. Suggestions included that the Hive would not be able to display the seating towards the hallways of the library, which would leave out a smaller, but significant, portion of the total available seating. Some suggestions to extend functionality included the use of “flower” branches or “roots” intertwining with the overhead lights. For this prototype however, we decided to assist students in finding seats only in the main areas because those seats largely fit students’ needs that we gathered from interviews such as chairs with desks, outlets and tables. We also received several design suggestions aimed at displaying group seating, the most common was using granular light displays, which we couldn't do with our EL wire nor the Unity model due to time constraints.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              During our questionnaire we also had students flip through slides of two colors, asking them to mark one as \"positive\" and the other \"negative\", or that neither stood out. This was to help us determine what colors would work best to color the Hive. We ended up with a hierarchy like this:\n            </p>\n            <img src={colors} alt=\"green blue violet yellow orange red\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">From available to unavailable seating</p>\n\n            <p>\n              This scale informs us of a gradient system that could be implemented in order to have a more continuous display of availability instead of the current binary mode. Interestingly, the scale moves from colors that are generally seen as “cool” to those thought of as “warm,” meaning the idea of “availability” may just be a converse rating of activity.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Further Design Considerations</h4>\n            <p>\n              <b>Test colors pairings to convey available or unavailable areas.</b> <br/>\n              For the physical prototypes we were limited to a certain set of colors that were available in the form of EL wires which were green and blue. After testing different colors on the 3D model and questionnaires, the pair of colors that seemed to communicate empty and full most clearly were green and red. Therefore, for future iterations we would need to test with different hues and lightness of the two colors to find a specific pair that are visible with sunlight as well not being intrusive for students studying or lacking accessibility.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Improve the way we communicate how full or empty the seating area is and provide more details about the seating.</b> <br/>\n              Information such as whether there is a table of four is available for group work or four individual seats available. Currently, we are communicating that information the same way on the tree, and students can only see that there is an open seat but not know if it is for an individual or a group. Our next iteration would immediately address this issue. We would test various ways of communicating this information by either brightness or pulsing light. This idea is one that will need extensive testing at a large scale to see if it could work in the CULC environment.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Work on a final architectural design of the tree.</b> <br/>\n              The largest design challenge that we had while working on this project was creating a sculpture that maintained a tree-like appearance with enough branches so that it did not seem empty while also having the required number of branches so that users did not get confused as to which branch was pointing to which area or floor. Therefore, a future design implication could be to create large main branches that point to the main seating areas and have smaller, minor branches to point towards smaller seating areas.\n            </p>\n          </span>\n                   }/>\n    )\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default Hive;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/hive/Hive.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Medi.css';\n\nimport PortfolioPage from '../../../components/project-page/ProjectPage';\nimport Slider from 'react-slick';\n\nimport ecosystem from '../../../media/medi/ecosystem.png';\nimport container from '../../../media/medi/container.jpg';\nimport process from '../../../media/medi/process.svg';\n\nimport figure_1 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_1.jpg';\nimport figure_2 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_2.jpg';\nimport figure_3 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_3.jpg';\nimport figure_4 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_4.jpg';\n\nimport lofi_1 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_1.jpg';\nimport lofi_2 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_2.jpg';\nimport lofi_3 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_3.jpg';\nimport lofi_4 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_4.jpg';\nimport lofi_5 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_5.jpg';\nimport lofi_6 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_6.jpg';\nimport lofi_7 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_7.jpg';\n\nimport persona from '../../../media/medi/persona.png';\n\nimport autodesk from '../../../media/medi/physical/autodesk.png';\nimport watch from '../../../media/medi/physical/watch.jpg';\nimport brainstorming from '../../../media/medi/physical/brainstorming.jpg';\nimport moodboard from '../../../media/medi/physical/moodboard.jpg'\nimport faces from '../../../media/medi/physical/faces.png';\nimport poster from '../../../media/medi/physical/poster.png';\n\nimport wireframe from '../../../media/medi/hifi/wireframe.png';\n\nclass Medi extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    let sliderSettings = {\n      dots: true,\n      draggable: true,\n      accessibility: true,\n      lazyLoad: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1,\n    };\n\n\n    return (\n      <PortfolioPage\n        title=\"Medi\"\n        customLinks={[\n          {\n            name: \"Prototype 1\",\n            link: \"https://invis.io/C590SO1J7\"\n          },\n          {\n            name: \"Prototype 2\",\n            link: \"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl\"\n          }\n        ]}\n        nextProject=\"/portfolio/argon\"\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h4>What is it?</h4>\n            <p>\n              An app ecosystem to support the elderly and their caretakers in taking their prescribed medication properly and on time.\n            </p>\n            <img src={ecosystem} alt=\"phone, watch, and dispenser\" />\n            <h4>Origins</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              For fall semester of my master's program, I took a class which focused on teaching how to design interfaces from low to high fidelity. We were given an assignment to design an application that would assist both the elderly and their caretakers in taking prescription medication.  When designing these apps I was really influenced by the idea of <a href=\"https://medium.com/swarm-nyc/complexion-reduction-a-new-trend-in-mobile-design-cef033a0b978#.h55s4jdug\" target=\"_blank\">complexion reduction.</a>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For this application, three aspects of a prototype were created:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>A mobile application for the caretaker to use to check up on their patient</li>\n                <li>A physical artifact which allows the patient to track their medication</li>\n                <li>An automatic pill dispensing device for the patient with an embedded screen</li>\n              </ul>\n            <h4>Problem Space</h4>\n            <p>\n              As the elderly population continues to increase, so too does the amount of prescriptions given out per year. Elderly patients can often forget to take their doses, or take them late, which can affect the effectiveness of a medication, or can cause medical complications. Caretakers and doctors are concerned about ensuring patients take their medications on time, and it would be useful if there were a way to monitor and track if patients do.

Although this is nowhere as good as user research, for the purpose of this class it made sense as the professor already had the app and its general features in mind.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Scenario</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">Thomas is a middle-aged businessman taking care of his older father, Harry, who is now living in his family’s home. Harry is about 80 years old and has to take several pain medications for this arthritis, and has recently been diagnosed with depression due to his lack of ability from old age. However, Thomas has many clients across the country requiring him to travel often and not be home to check on his father.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For his depression, Harry has been prescribed Zoloft, and Thomas is very concerned that Harry takes it properly to keep his father in good spirits, along with his regular pain medications. To help alleviate his fear, Thomas has bought a new internet connected pill dispenser which allows Thomas to check on Harry’s medicine schedule from wherever he may be. The device has segmented areas for different pills, and allows Thomas to set individual times for each pill to be dispensed from a companion iOS app.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The companion app pairs with the pill dispenser through NFC, so that it can be used by other members of Harry’s family to check in on him. The app itself shows a daily schedule of what pills Harry needs to take for the day, <a className=\"figure figure-1\" href=\"#\">(Figure 1)</a> and can provide detailed information about any medication, such as what its was prescribed for, what its possible side effects are, and when the next refill is required, with a simple tap. <a className=\"figure figure-2\" href=\"#\">(Figure 2)</a> Harry can also choose to refill in advance if he so feels from the screen, which will contact the pharmacy on file to schedule a refill for him to pick up.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas can also edit information about the medicine, including its dosages and reminder times. He can set different priorities on the pills, so that Thomas can be notified immediately if Harry does not take his Xanax, but is less concerned about whether Harry takes all of his pain medications or not <a className=\"figure figure-3\" href=\"#\">(Figure 3)</a>, as well as see a weekly and monthly breakdown of how vigilant his father is at taking his medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In case Harry does miss a medication, Thomas will get a push notification with information about what medication his father didn’t take, and can choose to take action about it, at which point he will see detailed info about the medicine his father missed, and given the option to call Harry, their doctor, or 911 depending on the severity of the situation. <a className=\"figure figure-4\" href=\"#\">(Figure 4)</a>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas is very happy with his new app which allows him to monitor his father’s health while on the go, and is excited to see what other features this dispenser and app combo have to ensure his father continues to live a healthy life. Without this app, Thomas would have no way to consistently and easily keep tabs on his father, and would not be able to ensure that his father is taking the medicine he needs to stay healthy. His father also gets the benefits of consistent reminders, and peace of mind knowing that the machine handles the task of tracking medication for him.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Concept Drawings</h4>\n            <p>\n              <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_1} alt=\"schedule\"/>\n                  <p className=\"caption\">Figure 1: A schedule of the day</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_2} alt=\"detail view\"/>\n                  <p className=\"caption\">Figure 2: A detail of the medication</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_3} alt=\"editing view\"/>\n                  <p className=\"caption\">Figure 3: Editing a medication's details</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_4} alt=\"missed medication\"/>\n                  <p className=\"caption\">Figure 4: Push notification for a missed medication</p>\n                </div>\n              </Slider>\n            </p>\n            <h4>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Using the concept drawings I drew up some low fidelity prototypes, fleshing out the details a bit more.\n            </p>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_1} alt=\"Lofi schedule\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">The schedule screen</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_3} alt=\"Lofi medication view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Medication detail view</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_2} alt=\"Lofi medication editing\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Editing a medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_4} alt=\"Lofi list of medications\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Viewing the list of medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_5} alt=\"Lofi calendar view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Calendar view of medications</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_6} alt=\"Lofi profile view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">A profile of the patient</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_7} alt=\"Lofi missed medication view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Missed medication notification</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <h4>Persona</h4>\n            <p>\n              Based off of our initial scenario, we then developed personas to better flesh out the caretaker who would be using our app and the needs we would have to meet to ensure that they would use this app. So I further fleshed out the character of Thomas, and what he is looking for in taking care of his father.\n            </p>\n\n\n            <img src={persona}\n                 alt=\"Thomas (Tom) Dean. KPMG Accountant. Key quote: “I want to check up on my dad and make sure he’s taking the medications he needs to take.” Tom's Story: Thomas is a middle-aged accountant at KPMG, 46 years old, who is taking care of his 80 year old father Harrison, or Harry, who lives with him and his family. Harry is currently taking several different pain medications for arthritis that came with old age due to his profession as a mechanic, and has also been prescribed Thalitone for blood pressure in the mornings and Prilosec for heartburn. He must take these medications daily in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and Thomas is very worried about his father properly taking these medications. In order to ensure his father takes his pills properly, Thomas is interested in a pill dispenser with a companion app that allows him to track his father’s pill intake and alerts him if his father misses a dose so he can follow up with his father or the doctor to keep Harrison healthy. Due to his work Thomas is often not home and although his family is there to help take care of Harry, he would like to have extra peace of mind so that it’s ensured that his father never forgets to take his prescriptions. Tom's Demographics:\tMarried 18 years, father of two, B.S. in Accounting from NYU Stern, Uses tech on day to day basis, carries an iPhone and Windows laptop to work on the go Key goals of Tom: Be able to check his father’s medication schedule for the day, Be notified when his father misses a dose, Easy to contact his father or a doctor when a medication is missed, Be able to see when his father misses his medication over a week or month term so that he can see patterns if there are any as to why his father might miss a dose\" className=\"no-height-limit\"/>\n\n\n            <h4>Medium Fidelity Prototype</h4>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">After low fidelity mockups came the medium fidelity ones which were used for user testing.</p>\n            <iframe className=\"invision-embed\" width=\"438\" height=\"930\" src=\"//invis.io/DX90SMQU4\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n            <p>\n              In this prototype the following tasks are incorporated:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\n                  A user is able view all four tabs of the app, which include Schedule, Medicines, Calendar, and Profile\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Schedule or Medicines screen, users can click on a medicine to see details about a particular medicine, and click on the edit button to edit medication information\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Calendar screen a user can see missed medications, and click on a past day to see the schedule for that day\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  A user can also filter missed medicines based on priorities of the medicine\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  When a medication is missed, the app gives a notification that a user can tap to see details on the missed medication and act upon it if they want to (see this <a href=\"https://invis.io/ES90SOATH#/198511415_Home_Screen\">here</a>)\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n\n            <h4>User Testing</h4>\n            <p>Using the medium fidelity prototype on Invision, I sent it out to two people for user testing:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>my mother, a licensed physician who is currently practicing in a private clinic and could provide insight from a medical perspective</li>\n                <li>a fellow MSHCI graduate student who could find simple usability issues and heuristically evaluate it</li>\n              </ol>\n            <p>\n              My mother provided some great feedback (as mothers tend to do) from a doctor's point of view:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\"Time of medication should be simpler, either 9am or 9:30am\"</li>\n                <li>“Priorities classification is not useful”</li>\n                <li>“No one calls the doctor for one missed dose”</li>\n                <li>Appreciated how medication details show the side effects, and have refill button available</li>\n                <li>Likes the ability to see purpose and potential side effects of a medication</li>\n                <li>Maybe only show pills he misses on the calendar, otherwise can get busy</li>\n                <li>Would like to be able to make memos on the calendar on patient’s condition to discuss with doctor next visit</li>\n              </ul>\n            <p>\n              As for my fellow classmate, choice feedback included:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Priorities are a bit confusing</li>\n                <li>It was hard to figure out how to call my patient</li>\n                <li>Calendar was intuitive to see days he missed</li>\n                <li>Intuitive and makes clear use of iOS design guidelines</li>\n              </ul>\n            <p>\n              After this feedback it is clear that I should incorporate a proper onboarding process to describe what exactly the priorities mean.

This was my first foray into industrial design, so working with Autodesk Fusion 360 was pretty fun, and getting to 3D print our design was awesome to say the least. </p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n               <div>\n                <img src={brainstorming} alt=\"notes of designs\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">\n                  Brainstorming the physical device and its screens\n                </p>\n               </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={moodboard} alt=\"moodboard\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">\n                  A moodboard showing inspirations and guiding principles\n                </p>\n               </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <p>For my design, I decided to make my physical design a watch, as it is ubiquitous, its form is familiar to the older generation and they are also more likely to wear a watch. It is also less cumbersome, and has the advantage of being able to give subtle vibrations as a notification system. </p>\n\n            <img src={autodesk} alt=\"designing in fusion\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              The final design in Autodesk Fusion 360\n            </p>\n            <p>The watch is a simple LCD screen watch, with two buttons on the side to interact with the device. (Our professor forbade us from using touch screens, so no touch interactions!) Too many buttons would only serve to confuse the user on functions, and on screen cues help guide the user on what to press. The buttons can also be twisted, to allow scrolling, and have different colors. The band can also be swapped out, for the fashion conscious.</p>\n\n            <img src={watch} alt=\"the 3d printed watch\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">Live and in the flesh!</p>\n\n            <h4>Physical Prototype Display</h4>\n            <p>\n            <img src={faces} alt=\"wireframe of physical watch\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>For the screens on the device, I didn't want there to be too many states or screens that might confuse the user. The watch basically serves as a reminder and a logger, it reminds a patient when it's time for their dose, they can see what medication they've taken so far today, and be told what medication they've missed, which could be useful information for the caretaker or the doctor. </p>\n\n            <p>On its standard state, the watch simply shows the time and when your next dose is, as well as what you've taken so far using the color coded system. When it's time for a dosage, the watch notifies the user, and requires the patient to dismiss the screen as a form of confirmation.</p>\n\n            <img src={poster} alt=\"medi poster pitch\" className=\"portrait\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">A poster created to pitch medi watch</p>\n\n            <p>Overall the industrial design part was the most fun part of the project for me, as I was introduced to new tools and design constraints by working in a physical space. I also think I made a pretty slick lookin' watch.</p>\n\n            <h4>High Fidelity Prototype</h4>\n            <p>For the final leg of this project, we had to create a high fidelity prototype of the interface that would be on the pill dispensing machine. The dimensions were 480 by 320, and the design of the device itself was given to us, we just had to make the interface. </p>\n\n            <p>The device itself is meant to be able to be a standalone device, which means that all settings, interactions, controls, etc, had to be on the embedded screen, no accompanying app. Features of the device include:\n            </p>\n             <ol>\n                <li>Onboarding</li>\n                <li>Medication set up</li>\n                <li>Editing settings</li>\n                <li>Notification of medication dispensing</li>\n                <li>Standby or day to day operation</li>\n              </ol>\n\n            <img src={wireframe} alt=\"wireframe of device\" className=\"no-height-limit\" />\n\n            <p>\n              With these features in mind, it was relatively quick to create a wireframe of the device as I had standard assets across all three devices. Once these wireframes were reviewed by my professor, I then created an interactable prototype in Framer.js, fleshing out the interactions.\n            </p>\n\n            <iframe className=\"device\" src=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl/\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"allowFullScreen\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              <a href=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view on Framer</a>\n              {\n                window.matchMedia(\"(max-width: 680px)\").matches ?\n                  <p>Because this is an embedded screen device on a custom device, your screen must be wider to view it.

I was able to learn a lot about Framer.js, and also a little about how physical design works with Autodesk Fusion 360.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            If I were to expand on this project, I would like to user test it more thoroughly, such as see if the color classification system I came up with is useful, and if there are any confusing parts of the information architecture of the app, perhaps with a card sort. But I hope you enjoyed reading about this project as much as I enjoyed making it :)\n            </p>\n          </span>\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Medi;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/medi/Medi.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Slider from 'react-slick';\nimport './Rendezvous.css';\n\nimport ProjectPage from '../../../components/project-page/ProjectPage';\n\nimport leadin from '../../../media/rendezvous/rendezvous-leadin.png';\nimport wireframes from '../../../media/rendezvous/rendezvous_flow.png';\nimport phone_mockup from '../../../media/rendezvous/rendezvous_mockup.jpg';\nimport watch_mockup from '../../../media/rendezvous/rendezvous_apple_mockup.jpg';\n\nclass Rendezvous extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    let sliderSettings = {\n      dots: true,\n      draggable: true,\n      accessibility: true,\n      lazyLoad: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1,\n    };\n\n\n    return (\n      <ProjectPage\n        title=\"Rendezvous\"\n        customLinks={[\n\n          {\n            name: \"Github\",\n            link: \"https://github.com/LinkCable/rendezvous\"\n          },\n\n          {\n            name: \"Prototype\",\n            link: \"https://framer.cloud/GrnUD/\",\n          }\n\n        ]}\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h4>What is it?</h4>\n            <p>\n             An iOS app to help you find your friends in crowded places or, if left in the background, to encourage spontaneous meetings with your friends.\n            </p>\n            <img src={leadin} alt=\"rendezvous sneak peak\"/>\n\n            <h4>Origins</h4>\n            <p>\n              Rendezvous was inspired by the very hackathon it was created for. When our team first arrived at the huge Wells Fargo Center where PennApps XII was being held, we couldn't find each other and barely had cell service! This led us struggling for a solid hour to try and find where we as a team had settled down to work. Based on this, we thought an app which allowed you to find friends when you have no cell service would be awesome to have in certain situations.\n            </p>\n            <h4>What I Did</h4>\n            <p>\n              For this app I made the front-end in Swift, integrated it with the backend logic such as the accelerometer data, and designed all the screens you see below.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Implementation</h4>\n            <p>\n              At its core, Rendezvous is an app utilizing Apple's iBeacon/LBTE technology to discover friends around you who are also using it, and where you're close to each other Rendezvous will guide you to one another. Thus, when two friends happen to be close to each other, such as at the same dining hall or in the library, you can be notified that your friends are nearby! It's also useful if you lose a friend at a concert or in the woods where you have no cell service.\n            </p>\n\n            <h4>Wireframes</h4>\n            <p>\n              <img src={wireframes} alt=\"rendezvous wireframes\" />\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              A simple three screen user flow, a user signs up by using either Facebook or their contacts so we can know which one of their friends is on the platform.

Much of our hackathon time was spent working with Apple engineers who were just as confused as we were on some things we tried to implement from the documentation. Overall it was one of my first successful hacks though and I'm pretty proud of it.</p>\n          </span>\n        }\n\n\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Rendezvous;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/rendezvous/Rendezvous.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './SousChef.css';\n\nimport ProjectPage from '../../../components/project-page/ProjectPage';\nimport example from '../../../media/sous-chef/example.jpg';\nimport vui_draft from '../../../media/sous-chef/vui_draft.jpg';\nimport vui_flow from '../../../media/sous-chef/vui_flow.jpg';\nimport iphone from '../../../media/sous-chef/iphone.png';\n\nclass SousChef extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n      <ProjectPage\n        title=\"Sous Chef\"\n        github=\"https://github.com/abapat/alexa-sous-chef\"\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h4>What is it?</h4>\n            <p>\n              An Alexa skill that allows you to ask your Amazon Echo for recipes, have it read out ingredients to you, and get step by step instructions, all with your voice!\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"aspect-keeper\">\n             <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wj2yhEfdTZQ\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"allowFullScreen\"></iframe>\n            </div>\n            <h4 style={{marginTop: \"40px\"}}>Origins</h4>\n            <p>\n              For PennApps XV, my friend and I knew we wanted to do a hack regarding Alexa or chatbots, since they are the newest and most rapidly developing areas of software right now.

Find yourself washing your hands of flour or meat every time you need to check the next step?

I first read the docs on <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-voice-design-handbook\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa Skills Design Handbook</a> and took away some important factors:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Present information in consumable pieces</li>\n              <li>Make sure users now where they are in the flow</li>\n              <li>Get one piece of info from the user at a time</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n              With these and other principles in mind I started drawing up some potential user flows for a user asking Alexa for recipes. I made sure to include options to undo and go back in the flow in case a user selected a recipe they didn't like, or didn't have the ingredients needed for the recipe.\n            </p>\n            <img src={vui_draft} alt=\"a draft of a vocal flow\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">An early sketch of the VUI flow</p>\n\n            <p>\n              After experimenting many different ways to use the power of Alexa, I realied that it was talking a lot more than was necessary. You are unable to interrupt Alexa, which means you have to wait for it to read a list of recipes or ingredients. In response to that, I decided to limit Alexa to list five ingredients at a time because if it told you all at once it was overwhelming. I also incorporated the Alexa app so you would get a list of ingredients on your phone so you could skip Alexa listing out ingredients entirely.\n            </p>\n            <p>Other tweaks to this flow I made include:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Removing the timer and conversion functions due to technical limitations</li>\n              <li>Options to search for a new recipe if you don't like what Alexa gives you</li>\n              <li>Increasing the amount of recipes Alexa reads out so the user has a bit more choice</li>\n            </ul>\n            <img src={vui_flow} alt=\"a more finalized flow\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">A look at a more finalized VUI flow</p>\n            <h4>Implementation</h4>\n            <p>\n              Sous Chef was developed using <a href=\"https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask\" target=\"_blank\">Flask-Ask</a>, a Python framework for making Alexa apps using Flask, and <a href=\"https://github.com/dgtony/afg\" target=\"_blank\">Alexa Flask Guide</a> to maintain the user flow as Alexa does not have a native state handler.

People can use Untappd to log their beers, add friends and see their beers, and view ratings of beers from other users of the app. However, although Untappd is a pretty popular app among beer fans, the design of the app leaves somewhat to be desired. However, to be sure I was not just basing this off of my own beliefs, I first started conducting some research to inform my potential redesign and to find out what people use Untappd for.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Research</h4>\n            <p>\n              My research consisted of creating and sending out a survey to get an idea of what features of Untappd people use, and what their primary usage of Untappd consists of. I chose to do a survey as I don't really have many real life friends who use Untappd so I didn't have many people to reach out to. I spent a few nights crafting a Qualtrics survey to send out, and after I felt it was finished I posted it to <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/beer\" target=\"_blank\">the beer subreddit</a>, hoping to get a couple of responses:\n            </p>\n            <img src={responses} alt=\"247 responses\"/>\n            <p>\n              <b>I was floored.</b> This was more survey responses than I've ever handled before. I never expected to get this much information from reddit users, and am very thankful for their participation. With all these responses I could start to analyze my results confidently and trust the insights I gained.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Results</h4>\n            <p>\n              All of my survey was multiple choice so that I would not waste users time and could hopefully convince more of them to finish. I focused on asking about whether people used certain parts of the app I did leave certain options open to write in answers, as well as left a general feedback section for those who wanted it. (44 out of the 257 did!)\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Out of all the users surveyed, here's the breakdown of how they primarily use the app:\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"stats\" src={usage} alt=\"usage statistics\" />\n\n            <p>As is evident, most (87%) users of Untappd use the app as a personal beer log. However, one of the interesting insights is that double the people actually use the app to check a beer's rating than check what their friends are drinking (8% versus 4%). Interesting for an app that is supposed to be a social network.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              To further reinforce that point of a lack of social interaction, here's the responses for the question <b>how many friends do you have on Untappd?</b>\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"stats\" src={friends} alt=\"friends on untappd\" />\n            <p>As you can see, most users of Untappd only have up to 30 friends on Untappd (89%). In fact, 60% of the people surveyed only have around 1 to 10 friends! This is an astoundingly small number for a social networking app, and reinforces the idea that most people on Untappd keep to themselves.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Although users don't seem to be all that interested in interacting with each other, <b>about half of them are following venues:</b>\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"stats\" src={venues} alt=\"following venues\"/>\n            <p>\n              With this we see an interesting trend, that although users don't really want to interact with each other all that much, they are interested in interacting with a venue, which can include bars, breweries, restaurants, and beer stores. Most users said they were doing so in order to get updates from their beer list so they knew when they should go check out a new beer, either from a local place or from a brewery. Untappd users are very keen on keeping up to date on beers and tracking them, other survey questions revealed that of the 44% of users who add beers to their wishlist on Untappd, 73% are doing so to keep reminders on beers they'd like to try. Untappd users are also focused on badges, which they receive from drinking certain beers or performing certain actions in the app, one user explicitly said they added a beer to their wishlist \"for the badge.\"\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Finally, my last set of questions involved the Explore tab of Untappd, due to the relative popularity the Explore tab in Instagram has been enjoying and driving discovery of users, I was wondering how Untappd's fared:\n            </p>\n            <img className=\"stats\" src={explore} alt=\"explore results\"/>\n\n            <p>\n              In two words: not well. 75% of users rarely or never use it, and <b>out of all surveyed 22% did not even know the Explore tab existed. </b> This can explain why a lot of users do not have friends or do not socially interact with others all that much, most users aren't exploring the content on Untappd beyond what they or their friends create. Untappd boasts 5 million users according to Wikipedia, and most of that content is going undiscovered.\n            </p>\n\n            <p className=\"list\">To summarize the data gained from this survey:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>74% of users use the app at least once a week</li>\n              <li>87% use it primarily as a beer log</li>\n              <li>More people (8%) use it to check beer ratings than check up on their friends (4%)</li>\n              <li>89% only have up to 30 friends, 60% between 1-10</li>\n              <li>48% of users follow venues, and mostly (78%) for beer menu updates</li>\n              <li>44% of users also add beers to their wishlist, to keep reminders on beers to try (73%)</li>\n              <li>One user did it “for the badge”</li>\n              <li>1% use the explore tab always, 75% rarely or never use it, 22% were even unaware it existed!</li>\n              <li>Those who do use it, 42% are looking for nearby venues and their beers, or other beer related things such as nearby beers or breweries</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <h4>Insights</h4>\n            <p>Based on these results, I concluded the following about Untappd and its users:</p>\n\n            <b>People are posting, but nobody is listening</b>\n\n            <p>\n              Untappd is in a unique position as a social network as most people are creating content on their app instead of consuming it. This runs against the common <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)\" target=\"_blank\">1% rule</a> of Internet communities, which states \"only 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while the other 99% of the participants only lurk.\" It also goes against the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\" target=\"_blank\">Parento Principles</a>, which states that 20% of a group creates 80% of the content.\n            </p>\n\n            <b>Untappd isn't truly a \"social\" network</b>\n            <p>\n              Most users on Untappd use it simply as a beer log, and don't participate in the larger ecosystem. Responders left comments such as \"social aspect is lacking\" and \"it would be nice to be able to message others\". A social network that doesn't allow its users to message each other seems pretty boggling doesn't it? Untappd has a lot of potential to promote social interaction between its users however, and beer drinkers are not opposed to talking to each other: r/beer has an estimated 200,000 subscribers.\n            </p>\n\n            <b>The Explore tab has a lot of potential</b>\n            <p>\n              Most users don't use the Explore tab or don't even know it exists, but with all the content available on Untappd it could really be useful to people. Users could discover new breweries, new beers, or other users who share their tastes, all of this driving social interaction within the app. Right now the Explore tab is merely a list of options presented to the user and is not all that visually interesting or curated, but with the right touch could lead users to be more active on Untappd instead of just logging a beer and leaving.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              These insights provided a great guide into what to incorporate on my redesign of Untappd to make it more social and to help foster a community on Untappd.\n            </p>\n            <h4>Brainstorming</h4>\n            <p>\n              I began by drawing out some concepts onto my sketchbook based on the insights I gained. One thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to <b>redesign the Explore tab</b>, in order to foster more community involvement. I also wanted to <b>introduce a new Messaging feature to the app</b> to encourage users to talk to one another and foster dialogue about beer.\n            </p>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={concept} alt=\"drawing out concepts\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Sketches on how to design the four new tabs</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={ia} alt=\"info arch\"/>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Some notes from the information architecture breakdown</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n            <p>I eventually settled on reducing the number of tabs to four and making those tabs Home, Explore, Messaging, and Profile. I eliminated the Friends tab, as a user rarely looks at their friends list and it pretty much existed solely to accept friend request. Users can instead interact with friends from the new Messages tab, and accept friend requests from their notifications. I also drew up some sketches of how a new Explore tab might look, and refined it further while designing in Sketch. I also went through several key tabs and made note of the information architecture, to get an idea of what information the app would still need to convey amongst the four tabs and how the information hierarchy is currently organized.</p>\n            <h4>Designs</h4>\n            <p>\n             So before I go into detail I imagine you'd like to see what the current version of Untappd looks like:\n            </p>\n            <img src={current_untappd} alt=\"the current home screen of untappd\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">A look at the current tabs of Untappd</p>\n            <p>\n              And here's what I came up with:\n            </p>\n            <img src={new_untappd} alt=\"the new designs\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">My version of Untappd</p>\n            <p>\n              As you can see, I decreased the number of tabs from 5 to 4, and also introduced the Messages tab mentioned before. I cut the Friends and Notifications tabs, and moved that information to different locations (Notifications to the status bar, Friends to your profile). I also introduced a floating action button to make it easier and more intuitive to check in, as the current design requires you to hit the search button in the corner to initiate a check-in, when it really should be obvious and easily accessible, since it is the primary focus for people using the app. Now let's break down screen by screen the design decisions:\n            </p>\n            <b>Home</b>\n            <p>\n            <img src={home_comp} alt=\"the two home designs\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I kept most of the elements of the home screen the same. I simply moved around some visual elements, but all of the information is still present one way or another. The most glaring omission is the removal of the \"Friends, Nearby, Groups\" tab. I moved the content of Nearby to the Explore tab, since I felt it more in the spirit of exploring what is going on around you, and removed the Groups tab as most users in the research did not even know it existed, or what it did.\n            </p>\n            <p>Also for the home screen, the use of cards is important as they contain a single post and have a variety of posts. I decided to eliminate the margins on the cards as it felt like it was constraining the app vertically with no real benefit, and allowed more space on the card. I darkened the text on reviews, as your friends comments on a beer are really the most important part of a post, and moved the number of toasts and comment information into the card instead of having it hover underneath. I also added a star in the right corner to wishlist a beer that a friend commented on so you can easily keep tabs on beers you'd like to try.\n            </p>\n            <img src={cards} alt=\"all the card states\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">All possible card states</p>\n            <b>Explore</b>\n            <p>\n            <img src={explore_comp} alt=\"explore comparisons\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Explore tab is the screen with the most work done to it. Instead of having a long list of clickable items, I instead choose to show some items in the list, and give the user the option to see more. I also introduced a similar users category so that you can find people who like the same beers you do outside of your friend circle and start using Untappd more socially. Also I decided to introduce a bottom tab to allow you to toggle between nearby and global instead of having them be two different list items, simply tap to see the global popular beers or people.\n            </p>\n            <b>Messages</b>\n            <p>\n              <img src={messages} alt=\"messages screen\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The Messages screen is obviously an original invention, and serves to make it so you can interact with your friends on Untappd in a more meaningful manner that just comments. Introduce yourself to fellow beer fans nationwide, organize beer trades, set up a bar crawl, all of these are potential applications of talking with other Untappd fans within the app. In addition you can from a glance see some of your friends who have recently had a drink, and message them about it or click the beer to see its details. This helps foster discussion between beer fans and creates a sense of community, which Untappd lacks.\n            </p>\n            <b>Profile</b>\n            <p>\n              <img src={profile_comp} alt=\"profile comparison\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For this screen I aimed to reduce the list on the screen to more compact and visual representations. Beer list and badges are already accessible by clicking the number, so no need for them to be doubly listed, and subscriptions can be folded into the beer and venue screen themselves instead of having a dedicated list item. Users can also see the number of friends on their profile to reinforce Untappd's role as a social network, but not overtly so as the main focus of the app is still beer so those stats feature most prominently.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Below the fold on the current app design is the list of your check-ins, so I decided to move that up and condense the information in the profile card.
