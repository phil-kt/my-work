During this playtime, and after the craze died down, I was interested in designing and developing an augmented reality experience of my own for people to try out.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Upon arriving to Georgia Tech, I discovered that there was a lab dedicated to augmented reality in the <a href=\"http://ael.gatech.edu/lab/\" target=\"_blank\">Augmented Environments lab</a>. One of my fellow classmates was going to work on a project for the lab and she invited me to come to her next meeting with the professor. I accompanied her, met <a href=\"http://www.jdbolter.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Bolter</a>, and began work on Understanding AR.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Concept</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Understanding AR is a project inspired by Scott McCloud's book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics\" target=\"blank\">Understanding Comics</a>, which is a meta work that describes how to write and draw comics through the use of comics. Professor Bolter really liked this work, and wondered if we could do the same with augmented reality: create an augmented reality application about augmented reality. My partner, Victoria, and I took up this challenge and sought to create an AR book about the history and development of AR. We identified what we considered key moments in augmented history worth representing:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Damocles_(virtual_reality)\" target=\"_blank\">Sword of Damocles by Ivan Sutherland (1968)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoplace\" target=\"_blank\">Videoplace by Myron Kreuger (1975)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeTap\" target=\"_blank\">EyeTap by Steve Mann (1980)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality\" target=\"_blank\">Augmented Reality term invented by Thomas Caudell (1990)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_fixture\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Fixtures by Louis Rosenburg for Air Force (1992)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://artoolkit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ARToolkit by Hirokazu Kato (1999)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://wearables.unisa.edu.au/projects/arquake/\" target=\"_blank\">ARQuake by Bruce Thomas (2000)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\" target=\"_blank\">Google Glass beta test (2013)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Hololens (2015)</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"http://www.pokemongo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PokemonGO (2016)</a></li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n              With these 10 milestones in mind, we set out to develop a book that could tell this history of how augmented reality came to be in today's day and age.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Implementation</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              In order to create our storybook, we used the augmented reality framework developed by the lab called <a href=\"http://argonjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Argon.js</a>. It's a javascript framework developed by <a href=\"https://blairmacintyre.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Blair MacIntyre</a>, the head of the Augmented Environments lab. We used Argon along with <a href=\"https://twinery.org/\">Twine</a> and <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\">a-frames</a> to create our AR experience.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n  The general workflow was that I would create 3D models of the historical event we wanted to signify, and save them as .obj format so that they could be plugged into an a-frame and be rendered on the web. Once we had the model, we would write up a description of the event in Twine, and link it all up to a main storyline. We also had to save the images we wanted in <a href=\"https://www.vuforia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vuforia</a>, so that looking at an image would trigger the correct model to render.\n            </p>\n            <h3>What I Did</h3>\n            <p>\n              Determined the list of projects to represent, designed 3D models in Blender, and developed code in Twine for storybook features.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Some Models</h3>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={eyetap} alt=\"eyetap model\"/>\n                <p>3D model of EyeTap in Blender</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={argon} alt=\"argon model\"/>\n                <p>3D model of Argon logo in Blender</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n            <h3>In Action</h3>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={google_glass} alt=\"eyetap live\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Google Glass model</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={quake_live} alt=\"quake live\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Presenting to Professor Bolter with the Quake model</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={quake} alt=\"quake\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>What you actually see from the iPhone itself</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n          </span>\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Argon;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/argon/Argon.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Dots.css';\n\nimport ProjectPage from '../../../components/project-page/ProjectPage';\n\nclass Dots extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <ProjectPage\n        title=\"Dots\"\n        customLinks={[\n          {\n            name: \"Youtube \",\n            link: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1TvCtP7g0s\"\n          }\n        ]}\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h3>What is it?</h3>\n            <p>\n              An art video I made in After Effects for an undergraduate art class.

All drawings are anonymous, and can only be viewed by those in the same location as you looking at the same wall, ceiling, floor, what have you. In order for graffiti to work we used the gyroscope and GPS to gather location and orientation data to maintain the context the graffiti is drawn on so that you don't see random drawings floating in the air (unless intended to be placed there!)\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>What I Did</h3>\n            <p>\n              For this project I coded the front-end in Swift using AVFoundation and some invaluable cocoapods (<a href=\"https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit\" target=\"_blanl\">SnapKit</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gizmosachin/ColorSlider\" target=\"_blank\">ColorSlider</a>, jot, and <a href=\"https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift\" target=\"_blank\">Toast-Swift</a>). I also created all the assets and screens you see.

The Hive was conceived through research done in CS8803 of Georgia Tech's MS-HCI program, and aims to make it simpler and faster to find study spots for students at the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center (CULC).\n            </p>\n\n            <img src={leadin} alt=\"preview of the hive\" />\n\n            <h3>Problem Space</h3>\n            <p>\n              The concept for The Hive came about after noticing that students at the CULC often struggle to find seats, due to there being no easy way to see if certain seats were taken or not, which led to students walking around different floors for several minutes trying to find a suitable studying space. Having personally experienced this ourselves as well, we thought it would be useful to try and solve the problem of finding a seat so students could focus on studying, not searching for a place to work.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>What I Did</h3>\n            <p>\n            My contributions to this project include:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Defining the data we were interested in collecting for our problem space</li>\n                <li>Conducting interview sessions with users</li>\n                <li>Creating interview questions</li>\n                <li>Creating a task analysis after reviewing interview data</li>\n                <li>Development of a persona for a potential user</li>\n                <li>Brainstorming of design solutions</li>\n                <li>Modeling and coding of a Unity prototype for The Hive</li>\n                <li>Conducting user tests with both virtual and physical prototypes in the CULC</li>\n              </ul>\n\n            <h3>Research</h3>\n            <p>\n            After finding our problem space, we then began to conduct research on how exactly students use the CULC, how many have struggled finding a seat before, and other data points so that we could see if this was a real issue that needed solving. We began by distributing a <a href=\"https://gatech.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bJDYgX6eSylMEfz\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a>, conducting semi-structured interviews with random individuals in the CULC, and observing how students use the CULC as well as how long it can take them to find seats.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Refinements</h3>\n            <p>\n              After completing our research and analyzing the findings, we came up with three refinements to our problem space to better focus our efforts. <b>It turns out that there is not much difficulty in finding an open seat in the CULC; the problem lies in finding an available table.</b>\n            </p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings} className=\"carousel\">\n              <div>\n                <img src={affinity_map} alt=\"affinity map\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}} />\n                <p>\n                  Affinity mapping out our research data\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={task_analysis} alt=\"task analysis\" onLoad={() => {window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));}} />\n                <p>\n                  A task analysis I derived from our research\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n\n            <p>\n              This led us to shift our focus on finding available seating to finding available tables. During observations, it was made clear that there are plenty of unoccupied chairs; so many that students used them for other purposes like making a bed or keeping backpacks off of the floor. However, table space was precious and most tables were quick to be taken as soon as students left them.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Design Ideas</h3>\n            <p>\n              Based on this new problem area and the data we collected, we then began to ideate on possible solutions for finding tables in the CULC. We went through an exhaustive list of design possibilities, which ranged concepts such as a flag to indicate if you were open to others sitting at your table to stringing ropes across the CULC to create a sort of large scale hammock for people to sit and work on, we eventually narrowed down to three final designs:\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Solution 1</h3>\n            <p className=\"sub-header-p\">Display a screen at every floor showing seat distribution so students know where to find a seat, while also projecting seat information onto the wooden railings on each staircase.</p>\n\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={screen} alt=\"screen solution\"/>\n                <p>Possible visualizations of the heatmap and seat occupancy levels</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={screen_storyboard} alt=\"screen storyboard\"/>\n                <p>A storyboard for the screen solution</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <h3>Solution 2</h3>\n            <p className=\"sub-header-p\">\n              Introduce modular furniture that can be a seat or a table depending on the need, therefore increasing the amount of tables in circulation and making seating exist wherever it is needed.\n            </p>\n\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={furniture} alt=\"modular furniture\"/>\n                <p>Some concepts of what the furniture could look like</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={furniture_storyboard} alt=\"modular furniture storyboard\"/>\n                <p>A storyboard for modular furniture</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n\n            <h3>Solution 3</h3>\n            <p>A tree installation that can show students where seats are available from a glance, by following the path of branches lit by fiber optics, which change brightness depending on crowdedness and pulse based on noise levels.</p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={tree} alt=\"tree solution\"/>\n                <p>A concept drawing of the tree</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={tree_storyboard} alt=\"tree storyboard\"/>\n                <p>A storyboard for the tree's role in finding a seat</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n\n            <p>\n              We arrived at these designs by following two different approaches for our solution:\n            </p>\n           <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Make seating and tables easier to find</li>\n              <li>Increase the amount of tables available</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <p>\n            Both solution 1 and 3 are based on the first approach, as they aim to make it easier and faster for students to find an available table at the CULC and begin their work. However, not wanting to overlook an obvious solution of simply adding more tables, we also designed a solution that would provide students with more workspaces, which solution 2 comes from.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>The Tree</h3>\n            <p>\n            After feedback from our peers and discussion amongst ourselves, we decided to go with solution 3, the tree. The reason being that although solution 1 was conventional and certainly would have worked, the tree grants the benefit of knowing which floor to go to immediately instead of having to climb past every floor to see that statistics for the floor. The other reason being we wanted a solution with a spirit of art in it. Solution 2 was abandoned as it featured no computer in its design, and this being a human-computer interaction course we were forced to leave it behind.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n            The advantages of the tree, or The Hive as I will refer to it from now on, are several:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Students can see which floors are less crowded from any point in the CULC </li>\n              <li>The branches of the tree directs students to which areas are less populated</li>\n              <li>Can disseminate more information in a single structure (Such as noise levels and crowdedness)</li>\n              <li>It looks prettier</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <h3>Prototype</h3>\n            <p>\n            In order to prototype and test The Hive, it we required a bit of creativity on our part. Sadly we did not have the funds or feasibility to construct a full scale model of a tree in the CULC, so we made a small physical model out of cardboard, an Arduino, and EL wire to produce the desired effect of The Hive.\n            </p>\n\n            <img src={tree_live} alt=\"real life model of the tree\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">Our IRL tree</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Knowing that wouldn't provide enough immersion to have a user test it, I also developed a simulation of the tree using Blender and Unity so a user could play a first person walkthrough of encountering our tree in the CULC and using it to find a seat.\n            </p>\n\n            <a href=\"http://philkt.me/The-Hive\" target=\"_blank\">\n              <img src={tree_unity} alt=\"unity demo of tree\" />\n            </a>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              The Unity demo I made, click the image to try it!\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Using these two prototypes, we set up in the CULC and asked random individuals who were passing by to test our solution if they had the time. They were assigned a task of finding a seat using the Unity prototype, and then asked several questions regarding the physical prototype, such as where they would go based on the current orientation of the tree, differentiation of the colors, and then were given a post-testing interview consisting of several questions to gather feedback design recommendations.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Feedback</h3>\n            <p>\n              After conducting several user tests, this was the feedback we received on our prototype:\n            </p>\n              <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>The colors were somewhat of an issue; the meaning of blue/green wasn't intuitive, and some people had difficulty differentiating between them</li>\n                <li>The look might not fit in with the CULC's aesthetic since it is not industrial</li>\n                <li>It's eye-catching but not distracting </li>\n                <li>Some people liked it more than a simple display, others did not</li>\n              </ol>\n            <p>\n              Overall, it seems as though people liked the concept of the tree, however the colors needed to be tweaked for the final product, as well as the overall aesthetic of the tree changed to match the CULC's in order for it to match. Thankfully these complaints are mostly about things that were decided on due to our constraint on time to produce this interim prototype, and were further explored in our next round of testing.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Testing Round 2</h3>\n            <p>\n              After making revisions on our prototype, we then tested our prototype again, once more asking random passerbys in the CULC if they'd like to participate in a brief experiment. The process for this testing was a lot more structured than the first time:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n              <li>Users explore an empty Unity scene of the virtual CULC to get accustomed to controls</li>\n              <li>Users are assigned the task of finding a seat in the CULC without our tree</li>\n              <li>Users again try to find a seat, but this time with our tree in the simulation</li>\n              <li>Users are asked questions about their experience and of the simulation and about the physical model</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <img src={tree_v2} alt=\"newer version of tree\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">A look at the updated model</p>\n\n            <h3>Final Results</h3>\n            <p>\n              We tested five students, and each student had a reduction of at least 50% time in finding a seat between the standard CULC model and the tree model. Seats weren't placed in the same location, but were on the same floors to try and keep times somewhat standard across tests. Students were also able to quickly discern the meaning behind the tree's colors and branches during their think-aloud.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>We also received several design suggestions from our testers that could be implemented in a future model. Suggestions included that the Hive would not be able to display the seating towards the hallways of the CULC, which would leave out a smaller, but significant, portion of the total available seating. Some suggestions to extend functionality included the use of “flower” branches or “roots” intertwining with the overhead lights. For this prototype however, we decided to assist students in finding seats only in the main areas because those seats largely fit students’ needs that we gathered from interviews such as chairs with desks, outlets and tables. We also received several design suggestions aimed at displaying group seating, the most common was using granular light displays, which we couldn't do with our EL wire nor the Unity model due to time constraints.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              During our questionnaire we also had students flip through slides of two colors, asking them to mark one as \"positive\" and the other \"negative\", or that neither stood out. This was to help us determine what colors would work best to color the Hive. The color hierarchy ended up something like this:\n            </p>\n            <img src={colors} alt=\"green blue violet yellow orange red\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">From available to unavailable</p>\n\n            <p>\n              This scale informs us of a gradient system that could be implemented in order to have a more continuous display of availability instead of the current binary mode. Interestingly, the scale moves from colors that are generally seen as “cool” to those thought of as “warm,” meaning the idea of “availability” may just be a converse rating of activity.\n            </p>\n\n            <h3>Further Design Considerations</h3>\n            <p>\n              <b>Test colors pairings to convey available or unavailable areas.</b> <br/>\n              For the physical prototypes we were limited to a certain set of colors that were available in the form of EL wires which were green and blue. After testing different colors on the 3D model and questionnaires, the pair of colors that seemed to communicate empty and full most clearly were green and red. Therefore, for future iterations we would need to test with different hues and lightness of the two colors to find a specific pair that are visible with sunlight as well not being intrusive for students studying or lacking accessibility.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Improve the way we communicate how full or empty the seating area is and provide more details about the seating.</b> <br/>\n              Information such as whether there is a table of four is available for group work or four individual seats available. Currently, we are communicating that information the same way on the tree, and students can only see that there is an open seat but not know if it is for an individual or a group. Our next iteration would immediately address this issue. We would test various ways of communicating this information by either brightness or pulsing light. This idea is one that will need extensive testing at a large scale to see if it could work in the CULC environment.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <b>Work on a final architectural design of the tree.</b> <br/>\n              The largest design challenge that we had while working on this project was creating a sculpture that maintained a tree-like appearance with enough branches so that it did not seem empty while also having the required number of branches so that users did not get confused as to which branch was pointing to which area or floor. Therefore, a future design implication could be to create large main branches that point to the main seating areas and have smaller, minor branches to point towards smaller seating areas.\n            </p>\n\n\n\n          </span>\n                   }/>\n    )\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default Hive;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/hive/Hive.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Medi.css';\n\nimport PortfolioPage from '../../../components/project-page/ProjectPage';\nimport Slider from 'react-slick';\n\nimport ecosystem from '../../../media/medi/ecosystem.png';\n\nimport figure_1 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_1.jpg';\nimport figure_2 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_2.jpg';\nimport figure_3 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_3.jpg';\nimport figure_4 from '../../../media/medi/figures/figure_4.jpg';\n\nimport lofi_1 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_1.jpg';\nimport lofi_2 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_2.jpg';\nimport lofi_3 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_3.jpg';\nimport lofi_4 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_4.jpg';\nimport lofi_5 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_5.jpg';\nimport lofi_6 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_6.jpg';\nimport lofi_7 from '../../../media/medi/lofi/lofi_7.jpg';\n\n\nimport autodesk from '../../../media/medi/physical/autodesk.png';\nimport brainstorming from '../../../media/medi/physical/brainstorming.jpg';\nimport moodboard from '../../../media/medi/physical/moodboard.jpg'\nimport faces from '../../../media/medi/physical/faces.png';\nimport poster from '../../../media/medi/physical/poster.png';\n\nimport wireframe from '../../../media/medi/hifi/wireframe.png';\n\nclass Medi extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    let sliderSettings = {\n      dots: true,\n      draggable: true,\n      accessibility: true,\n      lazyLoad: true,\n      infinite: true,\n      speed: 500,\n      slidesToShow: 1,\n      slidesToScroll: 1,\n    };\n\n\n    return (\n      <PortfolioPage\n        title=\"Medi\"\n        customLinks={[\n          {\n            name: \"Prototype 1\",\n            link: \"https://invis.io/C590SO1J7\"\n          },\n          {\n            name: \"Prototype 2\",\n            link: \"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl\"\n          }\n        ]}\n        nextProject=\"/portfolio/argon\"\n        content={\n          <span>\n            <h3>What is it?</h3>\n            <p>\n              An app ecosystem to support the elderly and their caretakers in taking their prescribed medication properly and on time.\n            </p>\n            <img src={ecosystem} alt=\"phone, watch, and dispenser\" />\n            <h3>Origins</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              For fall semester of my master's program, I took a class called Interface Prototyping, ID6515, which focused on teaching how to design interfaces from low to high fidelity. For the class we were given an assignment to design an application that would assist both the elderly and their caretakers in taking prescription medication.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For this application, three aspects of a prototype were created:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>A mobile application for the caretaker to use to check up on their patient</li>\n                <li>A physical artifact which allows the patient to track their medication</li>\n                <li>An automatic pill dispensing device for the patient with an embedded screen</li>\n              </ul>\n            <h3>Problem Space</h3>\n            <p>\n              As the elderly population continues to increase, so too does the amount of prescriptions given out per year. Elderly patients can often forget to take their doses, or take them late, which can affect the effectiveness of a medication, or can cause medical complications. Caretakers and doctors are concerned about ensuring patients take their medications on time, and it would be useful if there were a way to monitor and track if patients do. Medi aims to solve this issue.</p>\n            <p>\n              (Note: this project was for a class, more emphasis was on interface design than user research)\n            </p>\n            <h3>Ideation</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              For the development of the mobile app, our professor assigned us to write a scenario/persona for the average caretaker who would find this app useful and better than the current method they are using. Although this is nowhere as good as user research, for the purpose of this class it made sense as the professor already had the app and its general features in mind.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Scenario</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">Thomas is a middle-aged businessman taking care of his older father, Harry, who is now living in his family’s home. Harry is about 80 years old and has to take several pain medications for this arthritis, and has recently been diagnosed with depression due to his lack of ability from old age. However, Thomas has many clients across the country requiring him to travel often and not be home to check on his father.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              For his depression, Harry has been prescribed Zoloft, and Thomas is very concerned that Harry takes it properly to keep his father in good spirits, along with his regular pain medications. To help alleviate his fear, Thomas has bought a new internet connected pill dispenser which allows Thomas to check on Harry’s medicine schedule from wherever he may be. The device has segmented areas for different pills, and allows Thomas to set individual times for each pill to be dispensed from a companion iOS app.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The companion app pairs with the pill dispenser through NFC, so that it can be used by other members of Harry’s family to check in on him. The app itself shows a daily schedule of what pills Harry needs to take for the day, <a className=\"figure figure-1\" href=\"#\">(Figure 1)</a> and can provide detailed information about any medication, such as what its was prescribed for, what its possible side effects are, and when the next refill is required, with a simple tap. <a className=\"figure figure-2\" href=\"#\">(Figure 2)</a> Harry can also choose to refill in advance if he so feels from the screen, which will contact the pharmacy on file to schedule a refill for him to pick up.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas can also edit information about the medicine, including its dosages and reminder times. He can set different priorities on the pills, so that Thomas can be notified immediately if Harry does not take his Xanax, but is less concerned about whether Harry takes all of his pain medications or not <a className=\"figure figure-3\" href=\"#\">(Figure 3)</a>, as well as see a weekly and monthly breakdown of how vigilant his father is at taking his medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In case Harry does miss a medication, Thomas will get a push notification with information about what medication his father didn’t take, and can choose to take action about it, at which point he will see detailed info about the medicine his father missed, and given the option to call Harry, their doctor, or 911 depending on the severity of the situation. <a className=\"figure figure-4\" href=\"#\">(Figure 4)</a>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas is very happy with his new app which allows him to monitor his father’s health while on the go, and is excited to see what other features this dispenser and app combo have to ensure his father continues to live a healthy life. Without this app, Thomas would have no way to consistently and easily keep tabs on his father, and would not be able to ensure that his father is taking the medicine he needs to stay healthy. His father also gets the benefits of consistent reminders, and peace of mind knowing that the machine handles the task of tracking medication for him.\n            </p>\n            <h3>Concept Drawings</h3>\n            <p>\n              <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_1} alt=\"schedule\"/>\n                  <p>Figure 1: A schedule of the day</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_2} alt=\"detail view\"/>\n                  <p>Figure 2: A detail of the medication</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_3} alt=\"editing view\"/>\n                  <p>Figure 3: Editing a medication's details</p>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <img className=\"concepts\" src={figure_4} alt=\"missed medication\"/>\n                  <p>Figure 4: Push notification for a missed medication</p>\n                </div>\n              </Slider>\n            </p>\n            <h3>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">\n              Using the concept drawings I drew up some low fidelity prototypes, fleshing out the details a bit more.\n            </p>\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_1} alt=\"Lofi schedule\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>The schedule screen</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_3} alt=\"Lofi medication view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Medication detail view</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_2} alt=\"Lofi medication editing\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Editing a medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_4} alt=\"Lofi list of medications\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Viewing the list of medication</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_5} alt=\"Lofi calendar view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Calendar view of medications</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_6} alt=\"Lofi profile view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>A profile of the patient</p>\n              </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={lofi_7} alt=\"Lofi missed medication view\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>Missed medication notification</p>\n              </div>\n            </Slider>\n            <h3>Persona</h3>\n            <p>\n              Based off of our initial scenario, we then developed personas to better flesh out the caretaker who would be using our app and the needs we would have to meet to ensure that they would use this app. So I further fleshed out the character of Thomas, and what he is looking for in taking care of his father.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Thomas is a middle-aged accountant at KPMG, 46 years old, who is taking care of his 80 year old father Harrison, or Harry, who lives with him and his family. Harry is currently taking several different pain medications for arthritis that came with old age due to his profession as a mechanic, and has also been prescribed Thalitone for blood pressure in the mornings and Prilosec for heartburn. He must take these medications daily in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and Thomas is very worried about his father properly taking these medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In order to ensure his father takes his pills properly, Thomas is interested in a pill dispenser with a companion app that allows him to track his father’s pill intake and alerts him if his father misses a dose so he can follow up with his father or the doctor to keep Harrison healthy. Due to his work Thomas is often not home and although his family is there to help take care of Harry, he would like to have extra peace of mind so that it’s ensured that his father never forgets to take his medications.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Key Goals of Thomas:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>Be able to check his father’s medication schedule for the day</li>\n                <li>Be notified when his father misses a dose</li>\n                <li>Easy to contact his father or a doctor when a medication is missed</li>\n                <li>Be able to see when his father misses his medication over a week or month term so that he can see patterns if there are any as to why his father might miss a dose</li>\n              </ol>\n            <h3>Medium Fidelity Prototype</h3>\n            <p className=\"starting-paragraph\">After low fidelity mockups came the medium fidelity ones which were used for user testing.</p>\n            <iframe className=\"invision-embed\" width=\"438\" height=\"930\" src=\"//invis.io/DX90SMQU4\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n            <p>\n              In this prototype the following tasks are incorporated:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\n                  A user is able view all four tabs of the app, which include Schedule, Medicines, Calendar, and Profile\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Schedule or Medicines screen, users can click on a medicine to see details about a particular medicine, and click on the edit button to edit medication information\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  From the Calendar screen a user can see missed medications, and click on a past day to see the schedule for that day\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  A user can also filter missed medicines based on priorities of the medicine\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  When a medication is missed, the app gives a notification that a user can tap to see details on the missed medication and act upon it if they want to (see this <a href=\"https://invis.io/ES90SOATH#/198511415_Home_Screen\">here</a>)\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            <h3>User Testing</h3>\n            <p>Using the medium fidelity prototype on Invision, I sent it out to two people for user testing:\n            </p>\n            <ol className=\"list\">\n                <li>my mother, a licensed physician who is currently practicing in a private clinic and could provide insight from a medical perspective</li>\n                <li>a fellow MSHCI graduate student who could find simple usability issues and heuristically evaluate it</li>\n              </ol>\n            <p>\n              My mother provided some great feedback (as mothers tend to do) from a doctor's point of view:\n            </p>\n             <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>\"Time of medication should be simpler, either 9am or 9:30am\"</li>\n                <li>“Priorities classification is not useful”</li>\n                <li>“No one calls the doctor for one missed dose”</li>\n                <li>Appreciated how medication details show the side effects, and have refill button available</li>\n                <li>Likes the ability to see purpose and potential side effects of a medication</li>\n                <li>Maybe only show pills he misses on the calendar, otherwise can get busy</li>\n                <li>Would like to be able to make memos on the calendar on patient’s condition to discuss with doctor next visit</li>\n              </ul>\n            <p>\n              As for my fellow classmate, choice feedback included:\n            </p>\n            <ul className=\"list\">\n                <li>Priorities are a bit confusing</li>\n                <li>It was hard to figure out how to call my patient</li>\n                <li>Calendar was intuitive to see days he missed</li>\n                <li>Intuitive and makes clear use of iOS design guidelines</li>\n              </ul>\n            <p>\n              After this feedback it is clear that I should incorporate a proper onboarding process to describe what exactly the priorities mean.

This was my first foray into industrial design, so working with Autodesk Fusion 360 was pretty fun, and getting to 3D print our design was awesome to say the least. </p>\n\n            <Slider {...sliderSettings}>\n               <div>\n                <img src={brainstorming} alt=\"notes of designs\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>\n                  Brainstorming the physical device and its screens\n                </p>\n               </div>\n              <div>\n                <img src={moodboard} alt=\"moodboard\" className=\"portrait\"/>\n                <p>\n                  A moodboard showing inspirations and guiding principles\n                </p>\n               </div>\n            </Slider>\n\n            <p>For my design, I decided to make my physical design a watch, as it is ubiquitous, its form is familiar to the older generation and they are also more likely to wear a watch. It is also less cumbersome, and has the advantage of being able to give subtle vibrations as a notification system. </p>\n\n            <img src={autodesk} alt=\"designing in fusion\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              The final design in Autodesk Fusion 360\n            </p>\n            <p>The watch is a simple LCD screen watch, with two buttons on the side to interact with the device. (Our professor forbade us from using touch screens, so no touch interactions!) Too many buttons would only serve to confuse the user on functions, and on screen cues help guide the user on what to press. The buttons can also be twisted, to allow scrolling, and have different colors. The band can also be swapped out, for the fashion conscious.</p>\n\n            <h3>Physical Prototype Display</h3>\n\n            <p>\n            <img src={faces} alt=\"wireframe of physical watch\"/>\n            </p>\n            <p>For the screens on the device, I didn't want there to be too many states or screens that might confuse the user. The watch basically serves as a reminder and a logger, it reminds a patient when it's time for their dose, they can see what medication they've taken so far today, and be told what medication they've missed, which could be useful information for the caretaker or the doctor. </p>\n\n            <p>On its standard state, the watch simply shows the time and when your next dose is, as well as what you've taken so far using the color coded system. When it's time for a dosage, the watch notifies the user, and requires the patient to dismiss the screen as a form of confirmation.</p>\n\n            <img src={poster} alt=\"medi poster pitch\" className=\"portrait\" />\n            <p className=\"caption\">A poster created to pitch medi watch</p>\n\n            <p>Overall the industrial design part was the most fun part of the project for me, as I was introduced to new tools and design constraints by working in a physical space. I also think I made a pretty slick lookin' watch.</p>\n\n            <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>\n            <p>For the final leg of this project, we had to create a high fidelity prototype of the interface that would be on the pill dispensing machine. The dimensions were 480 by 320, and the design of the device itself was given to us, we just had to make the interface. </p>\n\n            <p>The device itself is meant to be able to be a standalone device, which means that all settings, interactions, controls, etc, had to be on the embedded screen, no accompanying app. Features of the device include:\n            </p>\n             <ol>\n                <li>Onboarding</li>\n                <li>Medication set up</li>\n                <li>Editing settings</li>\n                <li>Notification of medication dispensing</li>\n                <li>Standby or day to day operation</li>\n              </ol>\n\n            <img src={wireframe} alt=\"wireframe of device\" className=\"wireframes\" />\n\n            <p>\n              With these features in mind, it was relatively quick to create a wireframe of the device as I had standard assets across all three devices. Once these wireframes were reviewed by my professor, I then created an interactable prototype in Framer.js, fleshing out the interactions.\n            </p>\n\n            <iframe className=\"device\" src=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl/\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowFullScreen=\"allowFullScreen\"/>\n            <p className=\"caption\">\n              <a href=\"https://framer.cloud/WQdrl\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view on Framer</a>\n              {\n                window.matchMedia(\"(max-width: 680px)\").matches ?\n                  <p>Because this is an embedded screen device on a custom device, your screen must be wider to view it.

I was able to learn a lot about Framer.js, and also a little about how physical design works with Autodesk Fusion 360.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            If I were to expand on this project, I would like to user test it more thoroughly, such as see if the color classification system I came up with is useful, and if there are any confusing parts of the information architecture of the app, perhaps with a card sort. But I hope you enjoyed reading about this project as much as I enjoyed making it :)\n            </p>\n          </span>\n        }\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Medi;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/portfolio/medi/Medi.js","var canUseDOM = !!(\n  typeof window !== 'undefined' &&\n  window.document &&\n  window.document.createElement\n);\n\nmodule.exports = canUseDOM;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/can-use-dom/index.js\n// module id = 140\n// module chunks = 0","/*!\n * enquire.js v2.1.1 - Awesome Media Queries in JavaScript\n * Copyright (c) 2014 Nick Williams - http://wicky.nillia.ms/enquire.js\n * License: MIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n */\n\n;(function (name, context, factory) {\n\tvar matchMedia = window.matchMedia;\n\n\tif (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {\n\t\tmodule.exports = factory(matchMedia);\n\t}\n\telse if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n\t\tdefine(function() {\n\t\t\treturn (context[name] = factory(matchMedia));\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\telse {\n\t\tcontext[name] = factory(matchMedia);\n\t}\n}('enquire', this, function (matchMedia) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\n    /*jshint unused:false */\n    /**\n     * Helper function for iterating over a collection\n     *\n     * @param collection\n     * @param fn\n     */\n    function each(collection, fn) {\n        var i      = 0,\n            length = collection.length,\n            cont;\n\n        for(i; i < length; i++) {\n            cont = fn(collection[i], i);\n            if(cont === false) {\n                break; //allow early exit\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Helper function for determining whether target object is an array\n     *\n     * @param target the object under test\n     * @return {Boolean} true if array, false otherwise\n     */\n    function isArray(target) {\n        return Object.prototype.toString.apply(target) === '[object Array]';\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Helper function for determining whether target object is a function\n     *\n     * @param target the object under test\n     * @return {Boolean} true if function, false otherwise\n     */\n    function isFunction(target) {\n        return typeof target === 'function';\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Delegate to handle a media query being matched and unmatched.\n     *\n     * @param {object} options\n     * @param {function} options.match callback for when the media query is matched\n     * @param {function} [options.unmatch] callback for when the media query is unmatched\n     * @param {function} [options.setup] one-time callback triggered the first time a query is matched\n     * @param {boolean} [options.deferSetup=false] should the setup callback be run immediately, rather than first time query is matched?\n     * @constructor\n     */\n    function QueryHandler(options) {\n        this.options = options;\n        !options.deferSetup && this.setup();\n    }\n    QueryHandler.prototype = {\n\n        /**\n         * coordinates setup of the handler\n         *\n         * @function\n         */\n        setup : function() {\n            if(this.options.setup) {\n                this.options.setup();\n            }\n            this.initialised = true;\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * coordinates setup and triggering of the handler\n         *\n         * @function\n         */\n        on : function() {\n            !this.initialised && this.setup();\n            this.options.match && this.options.match();\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * coordinates the unmatch event for the handler\n         *\n         * @function\n         */\n        off : function() {\n            this.options.unmatch && this.options.unmatch();\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * called when a handler is to be destroyed.\n         * delegates to the destroy or unmatch callbacks, depending on availability.\n         *\n         * @function\n         */\n        destroy : function() {\n            this.options.destroy ? this.options.destroy() : this.off();\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * determines equality by reference.\n         * if object is supplied compare options, if function, compare match callback\n         *\n         * @function\n         * @param {object || function} [target] the target for comparison\n         */\n        equals : function(target) {\n            return this.options === target || this.options.match === target;\n        }\n\n    };\n    /**\n     * Represents a single media query, manages it's state and registered handlers for this query\n     *\n     * @constructor\n     * @param {string} query the media query string\n     * @param {boolean} [isUnconditional=false] whether the media query should run regardless of whether the conditions are met.
